# Container and Microservices Health Orchestrator

## 💡 Problem Statement

In modern cloud-native architectures, applications are composed of multiple microservices running in containers. Ensuring that these services stay healthy and self-heal in case of failures is critical for system reliability and user experience.

This project implements an **automated health orchestrator** that:

- **Monitors microservices health metrics** (CPU, memory, error rates, etc.).
- **Predicts failures** using ML-based or rule-based models.
- **Classifies failure types** and selects optimal healing actions.
- **Executes automated orchestration actions** such as service restart, scaling, or traffic rerouting.
